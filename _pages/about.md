Hi! I'm Qaiser Abbas, a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Computer Science, University of Engineering and Technology Lahore. I'm an applied A.I researcher interested in basic research and real-world applications of deep learning and computer vision. Previously, I have worked at [Bioinformatics Research Lab](https://www.kics.edu.pk/labs/about/brl) and [Computer Vision and Machine Learning Research Lab](https://www.kics.edu.pk/labs/about/22) as Research Assistant in various Medical Image Computing and Image Recognition Projects.

I am broadly interested in learning from limited data for visual recognition problems. My primary area of interests include transfer learning and self supervised learning with applications to medical image computing, computational plant pathology and industrial defects detection. I believe that artifical vision and learning from limited data can help us in improved object recognition, detection and segmentation to solve real-world problems. 

News!
